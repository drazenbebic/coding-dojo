## Publishing NPM Packages in GitHub

In this coding dojo session you will learn how to publish your very own NPM
package to the GitHub repository.

### Setup

- Search and replace `@drazenbebic/coding-dojo` with `@drazenbebic/coding-dojo-${NUMBER}`. The `${NUMBER}` is taken
  from the repository you have been assigned.
- Replace the `${NODE_AUTH_TOKEN}` in the `.yarnrc.yml` file with the Secret from [this link](https://privatebin.moonshiner.dev/?01cfcd64e7c23c2b#2dTi5CUsTMugeBNff6MsCybViiJHA29YAjtcaYDB6dck)
- Run `yarn install`

> Important: You can't commit with your changes in the .yarnrc.yml file, those
> are just working changes. Make sure to revert the file before commiting.
